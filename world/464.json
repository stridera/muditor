Most spectacular is his head, a fine grey setting about orange eyes, beak, and two chestnut-orange cheek coverts.

Like the emu, the cassowary's feathers are double-shafted, splitting about halfway down their length into two smaller feathers and are finely-filamented giving it a hairy appearance.  Two powerful legs give it a ground speed similar to that of the ostrich, and like that larger bird the cassowary lacks wings.  As if to prove the link to dinosaurs of old, the cassowary's head is crowned with a prominent bony casque or ridge, and a turkey-like wattle hangs from its neck.  Mostly black of body, the bird's neck is highlighted with blue and red. This particular bird must have injured itself either in some kind of territory dispute or another accident, as one leg has been splinted by the crack veterinary staff of the Ickle Aviary.  Hopefully in a few weeks the cassowary will be back to its old self, but for now it is a bit peeved at being cooped up in the infirmary.",

A series of basins carry water down the sides as they fill and overflow, the glistening liquid eventually running out a large sluice on the western side where the vast volume of water becomes a swift brook. All manner of the aviary's winged species wing about in the flowing water, splashing the life-giving fluid all about as they make fun of the simple task of bathing on this warm afternoon.  So many of the brilliantly-plumed creatures light upon the marble basins that the fountain looks more a floral arrangement than a sculpture.  Perhaps you wondered at first about the plainness of the white marble, but as a backdrop for the avians it makes a perfect picture. Carved into the side of the fountain nearest you is some kind of inscription, though you'd need to take a closer look to make out what the letters say.  Just below the inscription is a circular carving of a beautiful woman set bas-relief in the gleaming white stone."

The core of the droppings is a greenish-grey snakelike solid, surrounded by an off-white liquid that is quickly drying in the sun.  Though bird droppings do not have the disgusting smell of other animal feces, they are still rather repulsive nonetheless."

To ease the homesickness of her native land thus the good residents of Ickle did build this sanctuary and populate it with the colors of the birds of the south. The Aviary is more than merely a place to sight-see; indeed, industrious young adventurers might find glory and honor to be won, and perhaps the dark hearts of those more bent from light and happiness might feel some of the weight lifted from their burden.

Many of the tools do not look to have been recently used, a testament to the splendid way the flora of the aviary has taken to root even in this arctic waste.  The only exit leads north. ",

Along the south wall are a handful of observation cages where sick birds may spend the night or a couple of days getting better before being released back into the \"wilds\" of the aviary itself.
