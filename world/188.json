Despite its apparent handicap, the dragon is definately at no disability, exuding an evident presence of calm and power.  A pair of long, membraned wings lie outstretched from his back, enabling deft, powerful movements.  A long, wicked tail winds out from the dragon's rear, lined with muscles to whip around as a weapon.  Mounted on a thick, sinewy neck, the dragon's head houses a brilliant row of sharply pointed teeth beneath bright, carmine eyes holding a powerful intelligence.

Two huge, webbed wings branch outwards from his back, undoubtedly providing tremendous lift, but the dragon seems to float without using them at all, as if it were lighter than air.  A long, sinewy neck projects from the dragon's shoulders, stretching a solid third of its entire length.  Atop its head two bright scarlet eyes peer out of the haze, beady dots looking deep into the souls of its opponents.  A chilly frost forms around the dragon's body, collecting on nearby objects and walls.  It is rumored that such dragons as this can change their form to a cloud to protect themselves from physical attacks, but few have returned from battles with mighty cloud dragons to support the tale.

It magically updates itself, listing only the species of dragons surviving. The dragons are separated into three major groups based on alignment, and each of these further divided into two groups each, the true dragons and the supplementals.  For the first three sections, each page describes one species of dragon, listing their alignment, type, average length, breath weapon, any unique spells or skills they might exhibit, whether they have the ability to shapeshift, and their relative strength index. The relative strength index is a device the Duclian Organizational Force uses to rank species' relative powers.  It is only an average estimate. These lesser races of the Creator are estimated to rank between zero and ten, but no higher. The final section of this catalogue details the powers and effects of breath weapons, special skills, and draconian-specific spells.  The appendicies also contains a page that will magically renew itself, always reading the names of the current leaders of each draconian faction.  At the time of this writing, the great 27 Senator Dragons are listed. Avahern the Chronicler Royal Library of Duclia"

The beautiful stone walls wrap around in an arc that opens up to a huge arch leading to the sanctuary to the west.  In the east, a smaller arch leads to the cathedral antechamber, above which a beautiful, tall stained glass window is emplaced.  Unlike typical stained glass windows, this one has primarily muted colors, many of which are blues and grays.  Similar but smaller stained glass windows appear periodically around the upper circumference of the rotunda walls where they meet the vaulted ceiling.  To the north and south, smaller arched doorways open to twin narthexes.  Barely noticeable in the center of the checkered marble floor is the vague shape of a fox, made up of a slightly darker, bluish marble. ",

Remnants of their theology remain in beautiful carvings and inscriptions in limestone walls and pillars.  The graceful vaulted white limestone ceiling is decorated by thousands of tiny embedded ultramarine-hued lapis, creating a glinting inverted starfield.  Soft glowing lamps are fixed atop each pillar, casting their light upon the polished surfaces of the marble floors and throwing dark shadows behind the rows of pillars.  Lightly stained in the gray marble, the dark blue image of a rearing fox is drawn where the pews of the sanctuary once sat. Outside the rows of pillars, some of the limestone pews remain, facing inwards to the hall like audience seating.  Huge glazed stained glass windows line the outer walls behind the pews, many of them dark blue or gray, allowing in little light and giving the hall a rather somber mood.  At the east end of the hall, a huge arch opens the hall to the rotunda and the remainder of the cathedral. From that end, the altar can cleary be seen on the other end, a low marble dais with several blue throne-like seatings. ",
