Dominating the center of the cavern is a huge obelisk made of ice.  It nearly touches the ceiling some 20 feet overhead.  An eerie light radiates from the center of the obelisk bathing the room in a soft bluish-white light.  At the far end of the cavern a small set of steps lead to a raised ledge.  At the center of the ledge, a small spring sends pure, ice-cold water into a small pool.  Directly in front of the spring, carved into the wall of this icy cavern you see a huge arctic rose.  The only exit is north. ",
