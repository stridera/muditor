His massive bloated pink body is supported by two muscular cloven-hooved legs, yet he also has small ratty wings which somehow manage to keep his massive bulk aloft.  His arms end in massive clawed hands he uses to tear up the land.  Two tusks sprout from the lower jaw and two from the chin of his gorilla-like head.  A defiler of the natural world, Brolgoroth corrupts the land with his very presence.  Each footstep sears the ground, leaving a trail of scorched earth in his wake.",
