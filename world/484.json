A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire would never stand up against physical attack."

The mural is crowded with images of paladins, monsters, and fair maidens.  In the centre of the ceiling is the image of a paladin who appears much taller and more powerful than the others.  The warrior stands before a rising sun, and his armour reflects the sunlight and shines with a golden radiance.  Next to the paladin stands a beautiful young woman garbed in a wedding gown, and at his feet is a stone tablet.  The tablet is inscribed with writing but at this distance only one line can be seen, the line which is larger than the rest.  The phrase reads: 'The Code of the Paladin.  ' Moving closer to the tablet may provide a better vantage point for reading. There is an archway to the west and a door to the east. ",

However, these items should only be given to those players who demonstrate their worth by exploring the area and braving the unknown. Therefore, we have instituted the following rules: 1) under no circumstances, do not give other players a map, or verbal directions, to any location within this area. 2) do NOT give equipment from this area away to other people. Do NOT sell these items to other players. I repeat- they *must* get the items themselves! 3) god and immortals will not 'explore' this area while invisible. Unlike other MUDs, Fiery does not allow its gods/immortals to run amok over the MUD and discover the game's secrets the easy way. 4) ignorance of these rules is not an excuse to violate them. Thank you for respecting these rules. To be honest, a lot of the above rules will be hard to enforce... but we feel confident the majority of players have the integrity to police themselves. However, if you are caught violating the rules, Lokari himself just might summon you to Oblivion. "
