Over a cavernous stone fireplace are the mounted heads of a wyvern, a griffin, and an ice couatl, all arranged around a large oil painting of the original Circle of Five. A large, comfortable-looking couch upholstered in crimson demon skin stands before the fireplace. Scatter rugs all over the floor are the well-cured hides of bears, wolves, and cougars. Some lesser horrors are mounted at head height over the waist high bookshelves along the east and south walls. The floor to ceiling windows on the north give a stunning view of the ocean, and provide light in the daytime.  At night the room is lit as desired by wall sconces and table lamps on the three small tables placed haphazardly about the room. The only visible exit stands to the south. ",
