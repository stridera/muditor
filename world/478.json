A little sunlight leaks through the noxious, immobile haze overhead, but most of the illumination for this strange and hellish land is provided by raging fires.  There is an odd glint in the western portion of the sky that could warrant some attention. Just barely visible through the smoke, a faint outline of a tower, apparently composed of metal, can be made out.  A narrow trail circles down the spire, providing the only exit from here. ",
